# linearAlgebra

This is a collection of jupyter notebooks, each self-contained with linear algebra examples and python code to illustrate the topic.

Much of the matrial is a part transcript from [Glbert Strang's MIT Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVKj3LADCnA&list=PL49CF3715CB9EF31D)
